# Quick Paper to Code 🧠⚙️

*Turning research ideas into clean, runnable code — faster than your professor can say "rewrite that ugly script!"*

## 🤔 Why this project?

As someone who collaborates closely with professors and researchers in the AI/ML field, I often find myself tasked with a familiar challenge:

> "**Can you implement this idea quickly?**"\
> (…three hours later…)\
> "**Why is your code so ugly?**"

After enough iterations of "fast but messy" and "clean but late", I decided: *there must be a better way.*

## 🎯 What is this?

**Quick Paper to Code** is a lightweight framework designed to:

- Rapidly prototype AI/ML research ideas
- Keep code **clean**, **modular**, and **reusable** using **well-known design patterns**
- Allow fast iteration without sacrificing maintainability

In short: it helps you go from *"this paper is interesting..."* to *"here’s the working code, Professor!"* — clean and fast.

## 🧱 Core Principles

- 🧩 **Modular design**: Components (models, datasets, experiments, configs) are easily swappable.
- ♻️ **Reusable patterns**: Inspired by proven software architecture principles (Factory, Strategy, etc.)
- 🚀 **Fast start**: Minimal boilerplate, maximal productivity.
- 🧪 **Research-first**: Built for AI/ML prototyping, not enterprise CRUD apps.

## ✅ Implementation Checklist

- [x] Completed basic framework foundation
- [ ] Multi-GPU training support
- [ ] Remote server or cloud infrastructure
- [ ] Ingest cloud platform (AWS)

## 🛠️ Getting Started

```bash
# Need update
```

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

To my professors — for pushing me to code fast, and then pushing me again to code *better*.
